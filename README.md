# ppsend

**ppsend** is a lightweight Node.js tool that automatically sends your **osu! performance points (PP)** to a **Discord webhook**, using real-time data from the `tosu!` WebSocket server.

---

## Features

* **Automatic Tosu management** — downloads and keeps the `tosu` binary up to date
* **Real-time osu! data** — reads your current PP and beatmap info live from the game
* **Custom Discord embeds** — color-coded messages based on your performance
* **Simple setup** — works out of the box with minimal configuration

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourname/ppsend.git
   cd ppsend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Rename `.env.template` to `.env` or Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxxx/yyyyy
   WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:24050/websocket/v2
   ```

---

# In the future, I will make an installer so maybe this will be easy to install.

## Usage

Run the app:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once running, `ppsend` will automatically:

* Ensure you have the latest `tosu!` build
* Connect to your local Tosu WebSocket
* Send PP updates to your configured Discord webhook

---

## Tip: Launch with osu!

To make it seamless, you can **add `npm run start` to your osu! shortcut** so both osu! and `ppsend` start together.

Example (Windows shortcut target):

```
cmd /c "cd C:\path\to\ppsend && npm run start" && <osu!.exe's path>
```

You can then set this shortcut to run before or alongside osu! to keep your PP updates automatic.
